<h3>These are 6 projects based on Machine Learning <br>
The details are as follows:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cancer_Prediction:</b></li>There are 10 features (x) that are computed for each cell nucleus:
<ol type='1'>
<li>radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)</li>
<li>texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)</li>
<li>perimeter</li>
<li>area</li>
<li>smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)</li>
<li>compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)</li>
<li>concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)</li>
<li>concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)</li>
<li>symmetry</li>
<li>fractal dimension (coastline approximation - 1)</li>
</ol><br>
For each characteristic three measures are given:<br>
a. Mean<br>
b. Standard error<br>
c. Largest/ Worst
  <br><br>The Target Variable (y) is Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
<br><br>We apply Logistic Regression to predict y with respect to all x and fit the best curve.
